Basic demo:

Created using basic CSS layouts we created earlier this semester. I also used a bit of Semantic UI
to create some nice looking themse in the interst of time (3 other projects and 4 finals...)

I learned PHP which I really wanted to learn (but never want to use again...) and I also learned how to deploy it on
heroku.com. I've had a small experience putting stuff on heroku: one django file and some rails applications (Love rails). The address is:
